/**
 * SECTION:clutter-offscreen-effect
 * @short_description: Base class for effects using offscreen buffers
 * @see_also: #ClutterBlurEffect, #ClutterEffect
 *
 * #ClutterOffscreenEffect is an abstract class that can be used by
 * #ClutterEffect sub-classes requiring access to an offscreen buffer.
 *
 * Some effects, like the fragment shader based effects, can only use GL
 * textures, and in order to apply those effects to any kind of actor they
 * require that all drawing operations are applied to an offscreen framebuffer
 * that gets redirected to a texture.
 *
 * #ClutterOffscreenEffect provides all the heavy-lifting for creating the
 * offscreen framebuffer, the redirection and the final paint of the texture on
 * the desired stage.
 *
 * <refsect2 id="ClutterOffscreenEffect-implementing">
 *   <title>Implementing a ClutterOffscreenEffect</title>
 *   <para>Creating a sub-class of #ClutterOffscreenEffect requires, in case
 *   of overriding the #ClutterEffect virtual functions, to chain up to the
 *   #ClutterOffscreenEffect's implementation.</para>
 *   <para>On top of the #ClutterEffect's virtual functions,
 *   #ClutterOffscreenEffect also provides a <function>paint_target()</function>
 *   function, which encapsulates the effective painting of the texture that
 *   contains the result of the offscreen redirection.</para>
 *   <para>The size of the target material is defined to be as big as the
 *   transformed size of the #ClutterActor using the offscreen effect.
 *   Sub-classes of #ClutterOffscreenEffect can change the texture creation
 *   code to provide bigger textures by overriding the
 *   <function>create_texture()</function> virtual function; no chain up
 *   to the #ClutterOffscreenEffect implementation is required in this
 *   case.</para>
 * </refsect2>
 *
 * #ClutterOffscreenEffect is available since Clutter 1.4
